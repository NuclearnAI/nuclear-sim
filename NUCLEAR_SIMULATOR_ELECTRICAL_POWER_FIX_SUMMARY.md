# Nuclear Simulator Electrical Power Generation Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Summary

The nuclear simulator was unable to generate electrical power due to incorrect steam temperatures in the secondary system. The root cause was identified as **incorrect initial conditions in the primary physics system** and **faulty steam saturation temperature calculations**.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Incorrect Initial Conditions
- **Primary coolant temperature** was set to 280°C (cold leg temperature) instead of realistic PWR operating temperature
- **Primary-secondary coupling** was calculating unrealistic hot leg temperatures (~295°C instead of ~327°C)
- **Steam generator saturation temperature** calculation was completely wrong (44°C instead of 277°C)

### Secondary Issue: Steam Property Calculations
- **Antoine equation implementation** was incorrect for steam saturation temperature
- **Steam generators** were producing steam at impossibly low temperatures
- **Turbine validation** correctly blocked operation due to low steam temperature

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Fixed Primary Physics Initial Conditions

**File: `systems/primary/__init__.py`**
```python
# BEFORE: Incorrect initial temperature
coolant_temperature: float = 280.0  # °C - TOO LOW!

# AFTER: Realistic PWR operating temperature  
coolant_temperature: float = 310.0  # °C (average of hot/cold leg: ~327+293)/2)
```

### 2. Enhanced Thermal Hydraulics Model

**File: `systems/primary/reactor/physics/thermal_hydraulics.py`**
- **Fixed coolant temperature calculation** to maintain realistic PWR temperature profiles
- **Implemented proper hot/cold leg temperature relationship** based on power level
- **Added proportional control** to drive temperatures toward realistic targets

### 3. Corrected Primary-Secondary Coupling

**File: `simulator/core/sim.py`**
```python
# FIXED: Calculate realistic PWR hot leg and cold leg temperatures
# At 100% power: Hot leg = 327°C, Cold leg = 293°C
primary_hot_leg_temp = 293.0 + (34.0 * power_fraction)  # 293°C to 327°C
primary_cold_leg_temp = 293.0  # Cold leg stays relatively constant
```

### 4. Fixed Steam Saturation Temperature Calculation

**Files: `systems/secondary/__init__.py` and `systems/secondary/steam_generator.py`**
```python
# BEFORE: Incorrect Antoine equation giving 44°C for 6.9 MPa
# AFTER: Correct Clausius-Clapeyron relation giving 277°C for 6.9 MPa

def _saturation_temperature(self, pressure_mpa: float) -> float:
    # Using simplified Clausius-Clapeyron relation
    # For typical PWR steam pressure (6.9 MPa), this gives ~277°C
    p_ref = 0.101325  # MPa (1 atm)
    t_ref = 100.0     # °C
    h_fg = 2257.0     # kJ/kg
    r_v = 0.4615      # kJ/kg/K
    
    t_ref_k = t_ref + 273.15
    pressure_ratio = pressure_mpa / p_ref
    
    if pressure_ratio > 0:
        temp_k = 1.0 / (1.0/t_ref_k - (r_v/h_fg) * np.log(pressure_ratio))
        temp_c = temp_k - 273.15
    else:
        temp_c = t_ref
    
    return np.clip(temp_c, 10.0, 374.0)
```

### 5. Updated Equilibrium State Creation

**File: `systems/primary/reactor/reactivity_model.py`**
```python
# FIXED: Set realistic PWR temperatures for power level
power_fraction = power_level / 100.0
target_avg_temp = 293.0 + (17.0 * power_fraction)  # 293°C to 310°C
state.coolant_temperature = target_avg_temp
```
