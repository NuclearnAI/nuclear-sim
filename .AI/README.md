This is a directory for AI coding assistants to store notes, scripts, and output results.

If you are an AI, please use this for any hard scripts or output files, unless explicitly instructed to make the script in the made code base.

This folder has 3 subdirs at the moment:
- `notes/` This is used for storing notes.
- `scripts/` This is used for making test scripts that are used to evaluate code. For example profiling or debugging scripts.
- `results/` This is used for storing the outputs of the scripts in `scripts/`.
