# Scenarios Module

This directory is responsible for defining and generating various operational and emergency scenarios for the Nuclear Plant Simulator.

- **`scenario_generator.py`**: Contains the `ScenarioGenerator` class, which can create predefined scenarios (e.g., normal operation, power ramps, LOCA, steam line break) and provides a framework for custom scenario creation. It defines the sequence of events and initial conditions for simulations.
