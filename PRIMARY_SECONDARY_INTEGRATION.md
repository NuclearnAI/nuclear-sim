# Primary-Secondary Reactor Physics Integration

## Overview

This document explains how the newly implemented secondary reactor physics integrates with the existing primary reactor physics to create a complete nuclear power plant simulation. The integration demonstrates the full coupling between neutron kinetics, thermal hydraulics, and the steam cycle.

## Integration Architecture

### 1. Primary Reactor Physics (Existing)
**Location:** `simulator/core/sim.py`, `systems/primary/reactor/`

**Components:**
- **Neutron Kinetics:** Point kinetics equations with 6 delayed neutron groups
- **Reactivity Model:** Comprehensive reactivity feedback (temperature, xenon, control rods, boron)
- **Thermal Hydraulics:** Fuel and coolant temperature dynamics
- **Control Systems:** Control rod positioning, boron concentration, coolant flow
- **Safety Systems:** SCRAM protection and safety limits

### 2. Secondary Steam Cycle Physics (New Implementation)
**Location:** `systems/secondary/`

**Components:**
- **Steam Generators:** Heat transfer from primary to secondary, two-phase flow
- **Steam Turbine:** HP/LP expansion, power generation, governor control
- **Condenser:** Heat rejection, vacuum systems, cooling water
- **Integrated System:** Complete steam cycle with mass/energy balance

### 3. Integration Layer
**Location:** `examples/integrated_primary_secondary_demo.py`

**Key Integration Points:**
- Primary-to-secondary heat transfer coupling
- Temperature feedback loops
- Load demand and control coordination
- Mass and energy balance across the interface

## How the Integration Works

### Step 1: Primary Reactor Physics Update
```python
# Update primary reactor physics (neutronics, thermal hydraulics)
primary_result = self.primary_sim.step(primary_action)

# Primary system calculates:
# - Neutron flux and power level from reactor physics
# - Fuel temperature from heat generation
# - Reactivity from all feedback mechanisms
# - Control rod effects and safety systems
```

### Step 2: Primary-to-Secondary Coupling
```python
def calculate_primary_to_secondary_coupling(self) -> dict:
    # Get thermal power from primary reactor physics
    primary_thermal_power = self.primary_sim.state.power_level / 100.0 * 3000.0  # MW
    
    # Calculate primary coolant temperatures
    # Hot leg: ~327°C, Cold leg: ~293°C (typical PWR)
    primary_hot_leg_temp = self.primary_sim.state.coolant_temperature + 25.0
    
    # Heat removal determines cold leg temperature
    # Q = m_dot * cp * (T_hot - T_cold)
    total_primary_flow = 17100.0  # kg/s (typical PWR)
    cp_primary = 5.2  # kJ/kg/K
    delta_t_primary = primary_thermal_power * 1000.0 / (total_primary_flow * cp_primary)
    primary_cold_leg_temp = primary_hot_leg_temp - delta_t_primary
    
    # Distribute to each steam generator
    for i in range(self.primary_loops):
        primary_conditions[f'sg_{i+1}_inlet_temp'] = primary_hot_leg_temp
        primary_conditions[f'sg_{i+1}_outlet_temp'] = primary_cold_leg_temp
        primary_conditions[f'sg_{i+1}_flow'] = total_primary_flow / self.primary_loops
```

**Physical Basis:**
- Primary thermal power from neutron flux drives heat transfer
- Primary coolant temperatures calculated from energy balance
- Heat removal rate determines temperature drop across steam generators
- Each steam generator receives equal flow and heat input

### Step 3: Secondary System Update
```python
# Update secondary system with primary conditions
secondary_result = self.secondary_system.update_system(
    primary_conditions=primary_conditions,  # From primary coupling
    control_inputs=control_inputs,           # Load demand, cooling water, etc.
    dt=self.dt
)

# Secondary system calculates:
# - Steam generator heat transfer and steam production
# - Turbine power generation from steam expansion
# - Condenser heat rejection and vacuum maintenance
# - Complete steam cycle mass and energy balance
```

### Step 4: Secondary-to-Primary Feedback
```python
def calculate_secondary_to_primary_feedback(self, secondary_result: dict) -> dict:
    # Steam demand affects primary heat removal
    steam_demand = secondary_result['total_steam_flow']
    heat_removal_factor = steam_demand / 1665.0  # Normalize to design
    
    # Electrical load affects overall plant operation
    electrical_load = secondary_result['electrical_power_mw']
    load_factor = electrical_load / 1100.0  # Normalize to design
    
    return {
        'heat_removal_factor': heat_removal_factor,
        'load_factor': load_factor,
        'steam_demand': steam_demand,
        'electrical_load': electrical_load
    }
```

**Feedback Mechanisms:**
- Steam demand affects primary heat removal rate
- Load changes influence steam flow requirements
- Feedwater temperature affects steam generator performance
- Cooling water conditions impact condenser performance
