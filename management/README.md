# Management Module

This directory contains tools for managing simulation runs.

- **`run_manager.py`**: Provides the `RunManager` class, which handles the creation, execution, tracking, and organization of simulation runs. It manages run metadata, artifacts (like data logs and plots), and stores them in the `runs/` directory.
