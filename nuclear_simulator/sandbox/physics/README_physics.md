# Physics Module

This module provides fundamental thermodynamic and fluid mechanics equations used throughout the simulator. It includes physical constants (e.g., universal gas constant), thermodynamic calculations (temperature-energy conversions, saturation state calculations via Clausius-Clapeyron), fluid flow equations (Darcy-Weisbach for incompressible flow, isentropic relations with automatic choking for compressible flow), and ideal gas law computations. These functions are used by the materials module to compute properties and by plant components to model physical behavior.
