Feedwater System Initial Conditions - REFACTORED

This module defines initial conditions for triggering feedwater system
maintenance actions through natural system degradation.

ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE:
- Cavitation damage drives impeller replacement (pump.state.cavitation_damage)
- Bearing wear drives bearing replacement (lubrication_system.component_wear)
- Lubrication system is single source of truth for all mechanical parameters
- All conditions map to actual state variables in the refactored system

PHYSICS-BASED RELATIONSHIPS:
- Cavitation damages impellers → triggers impeller_replacement
- Cavitation stresses bearings → tracked as pump_bearing_wear
- Bearing wear triggers bearing_replacement (separate from impeller issues)

KEY CHANGES FROM ORIGINAL:
1. Removed ~30 invalid state variable references
2. Aligned with corrected maintenance thresholds from nuclear_plant_comprehensive_config.yaml
3. Implemented DRY-compliant architecture with lubrication system as single source of truth
4. Added cavitation-based impeller maintenance logic
5. Separated bearing maintenance from impeller maintenance
